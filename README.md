## project made for hackgt8 by [Joy](https://github.com/joywying), [Lauren](https://github.com/Laireen), [Chi](https://github.com/udejiofor-chidobem), and [Micah](https://github.com/mielwyn).
  
Our general idea is to create a website to enable students at specific schools to exchange, borrow, and give away anything they want. General features that we intend to implement include:
- school email verification and/or SSO required for participation.
- different categories for borrowing, giving, and exchanges (no $ allowed)
- karma system 
  - rating system for borrowing (if people give stuff back within a specified time)
  - (different?) rating system for exchanging (if people were honest about what they were trading etc)
  - those who allow things to be borrowed should also reap some kind of benefit
  - needs to be somewhat resistant to manipulation
